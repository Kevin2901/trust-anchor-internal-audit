## 📌 Project Overview

The objective is to perform an Internal Security Audit for a fictional organization, analyze their current security posture, identify key vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements aligned with industry best practices.

The project demonstrates essential cybersecurity skills including risk assessment, auditing procedures, documentation review, and compliance-focused evaluation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this internal audit project, I practiced and demonstrated the ability to:

- Conduct an internal cybersecurity audit

- Identify security gaps and vulnerabilities

- Apply auditing frameworks such as NIST CSF and CIS Controls

- Analyze risks using likelihood/impact metrics

- Recommend appropriate security improvements

- Document findings in a structured audit report

## 🧩 Scenario Summary

As part of a fictional organization used in the Google Cybersecurity program, the task involved:

- Assessing access control policies

- Evaluating system configurations

- Analyzing audit logs for anomalies

- Reviewing incident response preparedness

- Identifying compliance gaps

This simulates the real-world role of a Cybersecurity Analyst performing internal audit duties.

## 📝 Audit Methodology

The audit followed the standard workflow taught in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate:

1. Planning

Defined audit scope & objectives

Gathered necessary documents

2. Assessment

Evaluated security policies

Reviewed user access and permissions

Analyzed logs for suspicious activities

Assessed network & system configurations

3. Risk Identification

Documented vulnerabilities

Assigned severity (High/Medium/Low)

Calculated likelihood & impact

4. Recommendations

Provided mitigation steps aligned with best practices

Suggested improvements in policy, access control, and monitoring

## 🔐 Tools & Techniques

Tools and concepts used:

Log analysis

Access control review

Vulnerability identification

CIS Controls

NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Risk scoring matrix

Policy evaluation

Documentation and report writing

## 📊 Key Findings

Excessive user privileges found in multiple accounts

Firewall rules were outdated or overly permissive

Missing security policy updates

Lack of MFA for administrative accounts

Insufficient log monitoring and alerting

## ✔️ Recommendations

Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

Update and document firewall rules

Enforce MFA for all privileged users

Establish centralized log monitoring (SIEM)

Conduct periodic security awareness training

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases hands-on competence in:

Cybersecurity auditing

Risk assessment

Security documentation

Policy evaluation

Log analysis

Threat identification

Professional reporting

These represent core responsibilities of an entry-level Cybersecurity Analyst.
